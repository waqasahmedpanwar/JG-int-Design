Designers also ensure that interiors meet safety standards and building codes while reflecting the client’s style—whether modern, minimalist, luxury, or traditional. Residential interior design includes homes, apartments, kitchens, bathrooms, and living spaces, while commercial interior design serves offices, retail stores, restaurants, hotels, and healthcare facilities.

Exterior design services focus on the outside appearance and structure of a property. This includes façade design, siding, roofing, landscaping, outdoor lighting, patios, decks, driveways, and entryways. In the USA, exterior designers consider climate, regional styles, and durability.
